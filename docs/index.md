# MagicAce Website Documentation

This documentation provides an overview of the MagicAce website, built using our open-source stack, [MagicStack](https://github.com/MagicAceDev/magic-stack).

## Overview

The MagicAce website is a showcase of our capabilities as a UK-based software development agency. We believe that great code is written by humans, for humans, and this site reflects our commitment to quality and usability.

Currently, it is a static site, holding page, but we plan to expand it soon with our full capabilities and offerings.
